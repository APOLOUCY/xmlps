      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Modern medicine applies variety of recording techniques to the human body:
and imaging techniques based on different physical principles include:</p>
      <p>Electroencephalography is a medical imaging technique that reads scalp electrical activity
generated by brain structures. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is defined as electrical
activity of an alternating type recorded from the scalp surface after being picked up by
metal electrodes and conductive media. Electroencephalographic reading is a completely
non-invasive procedure that can be applied repeatedly to patients, normal adults, and
children with virtually no risk or limitation. The EEG measured directly from the cortical
surface is called electrocortiogram while when using depth probes it is called electrogram.
When brain cells (neurons) are activated, local current flows are produced. EEG measures
mostly the currents that flow during synaptic excitations of the dendrites of many
pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex. Differences of electrical potentials are caused by
summed postsynaptic graded potentials from pyramidal cells that create electrical dipoles
between soma (body of neuron) and apical dendrites (neural branches). Brain electrical
current consists mostly of Na+, K+, Ca++, and Cl- ions that are pumped through channels in
neuron membranes in the direction governed by membrane potential. The detailed
microscopic picture is more sophisticated, including different types of synapses involving
variety of neurotransmitters. Only large populations of active neurons can generate
electrical activity recordable on the head surface. Between electrode and neuronal layers
current penetrates through skin, skull and several other layers. Weak electrical signals
detected by the scalp electrodes are massively amplified, and then displayed on paper or
stored to computer memory.</p>
      <p>Due to capability to reflect both the normal and abnormal electrical activity of the brain,
EEG has been found to be a very powerful tool in the field of neurology and clinical
neurophysiology. The human brain electric activity starts around the 17-23 week of prenatal
development. It is assumed that at birth the full number of neural cells is already
developed, roughly 10E11 neurons. This makes an average density of 10,000 neurons per
cubic mm. Neurons are mutually connected into neural nets through synapses. Adults have
about 500 trillion (5.10E14 ) synapses. The number of synapses per one neuron with age
increases, however the number of neurons with age decreases, thus the total number of
synapses decreases with age too.</p>

      <title>2. Anatomical Foundation</title>
      <p>Individual’s brain wave patterns are unique. In some cases, it is possible to distinguish
persons only according to their typical brain activity. For example, subjects who regard
themselves as rational types or as holistic/intuitive types may demonstrate certain higher
activity in their frontal left and frontal right hemisphere respectively. The production of
any of these rhythmic waveforms requires that areas of cerebral cortex be connected to
other areas and the reticular activating system in the brain stem. Various regions of the
brain do not emit the same brain wave frequency simultaneously. An EEG signal between
electrodes placed on the scalp consists of many waves with different characteristics. A
large amount of data received from even one single EEG recording presents a difficulty for
interpretation. When analysing the EEG it is convenient to think of the brain as three
sections:
The highest influence to EEG comes from the electric activity of cerebral cortex due to its
surface position. The cerebrum is the dominant part of the central nervous system and has
centers for conscious appreciation of sensation, initiation of movement, complex analysis
and expressions of emotions and behavior. The cerebrum consists of left and right
hemisphere with highly convoluted surface layer called cerebral cortex. The right one
senses information from the left side of the body and controls movement on the left side.
Similarly the left hemisphere is connected to the right side of the body. The cerebrum
consists of several layers. The outer layer, approximately one centimetre thick, consists
mostly of neurone cell bodies, which give it a grey appearance. The surface is highly
convoluted with ridges (gyri) and valleys (sulci). The main, deeper sulci are called fissures.
Beneath the outer layer are axons, which have a white appearance. Embedded in the white
matter are further collections of cell bodies called nuclei. Some of the functions of the
cerebrum are localised within specific anatomical structures, some are more widely
distributed. The cerebral cortex contains six layers. There are two types of neurone cell
bodies: pyramidal cells and stellate (granule) cells. The pyramidal cells are large and tend to
connect to distant structures in other parts of the cerebrum, thalamus, cerebellum and
spinal chord. There are many feedback connections. Granule cells are smaller and only
connect with other cells in their immediate vicinity.
The brain stem is the oldest part in evolutionary terms, and its structure, size and function
have changed little in the evolution of the vertebrates. It is an extension of the spinal
chord and has three main functions:</p>

      <title>3. Integration centre for complex reflexes, such as maintenance of body position and</title>
      <p>The brain stem controls respiration, heart regulation, biorythms, neurohormone and
hormone secretion, etc. There are four regions in the brain stem: medulla oblongata, pons,
midbrain and diencephalon. Each contains nuclei (groups of neurone cell bodies) and bundles
of axons. The pons is a bulge at the upper end of the medulla (Figure 94). The medulla has
motor and sensory areas for the mouth, neck and throat, and also controls the respiratory
and cardiovascular systems.</p>
      <p>The pons contains cranial nerve nuclei associated with motor and sensory functions of the
face. The midbrain contains the major nuclei that control eye movement, blinking and the
pupillary light reflex. The diencephalon is at the upper end of the brain stem. It contains
the thalamus that integrates sensation, before passing signals onto the cerebrum, and is the
site where pain can be consciously appreciated.
The cerebellum integrates information from the cerebral cortex, the spinal chord and the
vestibular system of the inner ears. The information from the cerebral cortex is motor
information concerning where the brain is moving consciously the body and limbs.
Information from the spinal cord originates in the position sensors in the joints, tendons
and muscles of the body. Information from the vestibular system concerns the orientation
of the head in three-dimensional space and its movement. The cerebellum thereby serves to
coordinate voluntary movement and maintain posture.</p>

      <title>3. History</title>
      <p>During more than 100 years of its history, encephalography has undergone massive progress.
The existence of electrical currents in the brain was discovered in 1875 by an English
physician Richard Caton. Caton observed the EEG from the exposed brains of rabbits and
monkeys. In 1924 Hans Berger, a German neurologist, used his ordinary radio equipment to
amplify the brain's electrical activity measured on the human scalp. He announced that weak
electric currents generated in the brain could be recorded without opening the skull, and
depicted graphically on a strip of paper. The activity that he observed changed according to
the functional status of the brain, such as in sleep, anesthesia, lack of oxygen and in certain
neural diseases, such as in epilepsy. Berger laid the foundations for many of the present
applications of electroencephalography. He also used the word electroencephalogram as the
first for describing brain electric potentials in humans. He was right with his suggestion,
that brain activity changes in a consistent and recognizable way when the general status of
the subject changes, as from relaxation to alertness. Later in 1934 Adrian and Matthews
published the paper verifying concept of “human brain waves” and identified regular
oscillations around 10 to 12 Hz which they termed “alpha rhythm”.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="7">
      <title>4. Brain waves classification</title>
      <p>For obtaining basic brain patterns of individuals, subjects are instructed to close their eyes
and relax. Brain patterns form wave shapes that are commonly sinusoidal. Usually, they are
measured from peak to peak and normally range from 0.5 to 100 µV in amplitude, which is
about 100 times lower than ECG signals. By means of Fourier transform, power spectrum
from the raw EEG signal is derived. In power spectrum contribution of sine waves with
different frequencies are visible. Although the spectrum is continuous, ranging from 0 Hz
up to one half of sampling frequency, the brain state of the individual may make certain
frequencies more dominant. Brain waves have been categorized into four basic groups
(Figure 1):
The best-known and most extensively studied rhythm of the human brain is the normal alpha
rhythm. Alpha can be usually observed better in the posterior and occipital regions with
typical amplitude about 50 µV (peak-peak). Alpha is also significant between posterior and
central regions in comparison to other regions. Alpha activity is induced by closing the eyes
and by relaxation, and abolished by eye opening or alerting by any mechanism (thinking,
calculating). Most of the people are remarkably sensitive to the phenomenon of “eye
closing”, i.e. when they close their eyes their wave pattern significantly changes from beta
into alpha waves. The precise origin of the alpha rhythm is still not known. Alpha waves are
usually attributed to summated dendrite potentials.</p>
      <p>Alpha waves contain frequencies between 8 and 13 Hz with amplitude less than 10 mV. They
are found in normal people, who are awake and resting quietly, not being engaged in intense
mental activity. Their amplitude is highest in the occipital region. When the person is asleep,
the alpha waves disappear. When the person is alert and their attention is directed to a
specific activity, the alpha waves are replaced by asynchronous waves of higher frequency
and lower amplitude.
EEG is sensitive to a continuum of states ranging from stress state, alertness to resting
state, hypnosis, and sleep. During normal state of wakefulness with open eyes beta waves
are dominant. Beta waves have a frequency range of 13 to 30 Hz, extending to 50 Hz under
intense mental activity. They have their maximum amplitude (less than 20 mV) on the
parietal and frontal regions of the scalp. There are two types: beta I waves, lower
frequencies which disappear during mental activity, and beta II waves, higher frequencies
which appear during tension and intense mental activity.</p>
      <p>Delta and Theta Rhythms
If sleep appears power of lower frequency bands (i.e. delta and theta) increase. Sleep is
generally divided into two broad types: nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and REM sleep.
NREM and REM occur in alternating cycles. NREM is further divided into stage I, stage II,
stage III, and stage IV. The last two stages correspond to deeper sleep, where slow delta
waves show higher proportions. With slower dominant frequencies responsiveness to stimuli
decreases.</p>
      <p>Delta waves have a frequency content between 0.5 and 4 Hz with amplitude less than 100
mV. They occur during deep sleep, during infancy and in serious organic brain disease. They
will occur after transactions of the upper brain stem separating the reticular activating
system from the cerebral cortex. They are found in the central cerebrum, mostly the
parietal lobes.</p>
      <p>Theta waves have a frequency range between 4 to 7 Hz with amplitude of less than 100 mV.
They occur mainly in the parietal and temporal regions in sleep and also in children when
awake, and during emotional stress in some adults, particularly during disappointment and
frustration. Sudden removal of something causing pleasure will cause about 20 s of theta
waves.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="8">
      <title>5. Applications</title>
      <p>Gamma waves have frequencies between 30 and 80 Hz with an amplitude of less than 2 mV
peak-to-peak and are found when the subject is paying attention or is having some other
sensory stimulation.</p>
      <p>The greatest advantage of EEG is speed. Complex patterns of neural activity can be
recorded occurring within fractions of a second after a stimulus has been administered.
EEG provides less spatial resolution compared to MRI and PET. Thus for better allocation
within the brain, EEG images are often combined with MRI scans. EEG can determine the
relative strengths and positions of electrical activity in different brain regions. Research
and clinical applications of the EEG in humans and animals are used to:</p>
      <p>Symmetry of alpha activity within hemispheres can be monitored. In cases of restricted
lesions such as tumor, hemorrhage, and thrombosis, it is usual for the cortex to generate
lower frequencies.</p>
      <p>EEG signal distortion can be manifested by:
Abnormalities may be found in organic brain damage, tumors, infarcts, hemorrhages,
demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), after viral encephalitis and in
epilepsy. Generally tumors, infarcts and hemorrhages are better detected by other means,
so the EEG is not used as a first option for diagnosis. The EEG is the main diagnostic tool
for epilepsy. Epilepsy is characterized by uncontrolled excessive activity in all or part of
the brain. If the activity is above a threshold, the patient will exhibit symptoms; such as
convulsive contractions of the muscles; “absences” where the patient is unaware of their
surroundings and does not respond to stimuli for a period of seconds or minutes; or
abnormal behavior.
Epilepsy may be partial or general. In general epilepsy the patient becomes unconscious, the
patient has a general tonic contraction of all their muscles, followed by alternating clonic
contractions. This is also known as grand mal epilepsy with tonic-clonic convulsions. Following
the seizure, which may last from a few seconds to four minutes, the patient is in a stupor
for a minute to a day or more. The EEG shows large amplitude, low frequency spikes from all
parts of the brain during grand mal. In between seizures, the patient may have a localized
area of the brain showing large amplitude, low frequency spikes. This region is known as the
focus.</p>
      <p>Another form of epilepsy, formerly known as petit mal, occurs as myoclonic and absence
epilepsy. In the myoclonic the burst of neuron discharges last only a fraction of a second
and there is a single, violent muscular jerk. In the absence form, there is a loss of
consciousness lasting for a few seconds, sometimes associated with muscle twitching and
eye blinking.</p>
      <p>Partial epilepsy can involve any part of the brain. It usually arises from an area of brain that
is damaged or scarred or has some other abnormality compressing the brain, such as a
tumor. Depending on the site of the focus, it can cause a wave of contractions spreading
over the body, a short period of amnesia only, an attack of rage or fear, or a repetitive
movement. The patient may or may not be aware of the attack but is unable to control it.
Stimulating the eyes with fixed or moving patterns can show defects in pathways concerned
with vision, or point to epileptic foci in those pathways. If a repetitive pattern at the right
frequency is displayed before the patient, focal or petit mal epilepsy may be provoked and
recorded. Comparison of timing along the optic pathways between the right and left sides
can show damage on one side causing delay in signals travelling from the retina to the
occipital cortex at the back of the brain, where vision is consciously perceived. This is seen
in viral optic neuritis, MS and vascular lesions (eg aneurysms: ballooning out of a defect in
the wall of an artery). Recording from the temporal lobe of the cortex, where hearing is
perceived, or the adjacent brain stem, while stimulating the ear with sound can detect
defects in those pathways. The advantage of this technique is that it does not require the
cooperation of the patient, so that infants may be tested for deafness.</p>
      <p>Epileptic conditions produce stimulation of the cortex and the appearance of high-voltage
waves (up to 1000 µV) referred to as “spikes” or “spike and wave”. EEG patterns have been
shown to be modified by a wide range of variables, including biochemical, metabolic,
circulatory, hormonal, neuroelectric, and behavioral factors. By tracking changes of electric
activity during such drug abuse-related phenomena as euphoria and craving, brain areas and
patterns of activity that mark these phenomena can be determined. As the EEG procedure
is non-invasive and painless, it is being widely used to study the brain organization of
cognitive processes such as perception, memory, attention, language, and emotion in normal
adults and children. For this purpose, the most useful application of EEG recording is the
ERP (event related potential) technique.
Sleep deprivation is one of the most common disorders of people today. Bright light
exposure is a common treatment for many sleep difficulties, especially those
associated with alterations in the circadian timing system. Electroencephalograms
have been used to research bright light therapy and its effectiveness. Two studies by
Badia and coworkers focused on the notion that true physiological arousal may be
caused by exposure to bright light. One of the studies used electroencephalogram to
monitor beta activity when subjects were exposed to light. Every 90 minutes a control
group was exposed to alternating sequences of bright and dim light. With changes of
illumination, log power density of the beta band increased and decreased. The
dominant frequency within the beta band was greatly higher during bright light
exposure than during dim light exposure.
As one of the most readily available and widely used drugs in society, alcohol has been a
focus of many researchers. Questions about the effects of alcohol on the body,
particularly the brain, as well as inquires about alcoholism as a disease are continually
posed by scientists. It is known that alcohol misuse has been linked to a large number
of deleterious effects on the central nervous system. Alcoholic patients may be
affected with several disorders at one time, making it difficult to identify the cause
of cognitive disfunction in chronic alcoholics. Electroencephalography has become a
major tool in aiding physicians to diagnose many of these disorders, as well as helping
researchers to look closer at the origins of alcoholism, along with its effects.
Scientists in Denmark conducted a long term study on the EEG sensitivity to alcohol
as a determinant for the possible development of alcoholism in high-risk men.
Standard doses of alcohol were administered to 19-year old sons of both alcoholics
and non-alcoholics. An electroencephalograph, administered with the subject's eyes
closed, used a six scalp lead configuration to measure four frequency bands (theta,
slow alpha, fast alpha, and beta) and the mean alpha frequency. The researchers used
the EEG frequency response to relate future alcohol dependence and level of
consumption. Their results showed that a smaller EEG alpha frequency response to
alcohol at 19 years was related to the development of alcohol dependence and high
quantity and frequency of consumption ten years later. The Department of Psychology
at the University of Tasmania in Australia investigated the link between heavy social
drinking and sober cognitive functioning in young non-alcoholic adults. Heavy and light
social drinkers (male) completed a verbal free recall task using various word lists and
had their event-related potentials (ERP) recorded while under the influence of either
a pharmacological challenge (larazepam) or a placebo. Each subject's
electroencephalographic activity was recorded using an electrode skull cap sampling at
a rate of 500 Hz. Grand-mean averages were computed for each electrode site and
each drug treatment condition for all of the subjects in the group. Results showed
that the event-related potential to recall and not recall words was reduced in heavy
social drinkers following placebo. The larazepam produced a distinct pattern of
antegrade memory deficits in both groups.
Medical history is filled with accounts of patients having stroke-like symptoms. In the past,
it was difficult to detect abnormalities inside the brain without resorting to surgery, and
thus, knowledge pertaining to strokes remained hidden. The electroencephalogram, with its
ability to detect abnormalities, such as those resulting from strokes, has opened many doors
for the detection and treatment of strokes. A case study involving a 62-year old woman who
suffered a small subcortical stroke compared a point-correlation dimension (PD2) of the
patient two years later to that of 13 healthy control subjects. An electroencephalograph
was recorded from 22 locations on the scalp using an Electrocap. The EEG was recorded for
two minutes under both eyes closed and eyes open conditions. The PD2 was then calculated
from every EEG epoch recorded at all locations. After the PD2 calculation, an overall grand
average was taken for all control subjects and the mean, for both eyes open and eye closed
in the control group and the patient was computed. The scalp distribution of PD2, calculated
from the EEG and plotted as z-score maps, showed that the control group's PD2 values were
symmetrical in both conditions (eyes opened and closed). In the patient's case, the
distribution of PD2 was asymmetrical. Analysis of the patient's EEG reading showed a
relative decreased of the fast frequency band activity at low dimensional area. This
demonstrates that even though the patient showed no obvious results from her stroke,
there is an observable difference in her brain waves compared to that of someone who has
never had one.
Evoked potentials or event-related potentials (ERPs) are significant voltage fluctuations
resulting from evoked neural activity. Evoked potential is initiated by an external or internal
stimulus. ERPs are suitable methodology for studying the aspects of cognitive processes of
both normal and abnormal nature (neurological or psychiatric disorders). Mental operations,
such as those involved in perception, selective attention, language processing, and memory,
proceed over time ranges in the order of tens of milliseconds. Whereas PET and MRI can
localize regions of activation during a given mental task, ERPs can help in defining the time
course of these activations.</p>
      <p>Amplitudes of ERP components are often much smaller than spontaneous EEG components,
so they are not to be recognized from raw EEG trace. They are extracted from set of
single recordings by digital averaging of epochs (recording periods) of EEG time-locked to
repeated occurrences of sensory, cognitive, or motor events. The spontaneous background
EEG fluctuations, which are random relatively to time point when the stimuli occurred, are
averaged out, leaving the event-related brain potentials. These electrical signals reflect
only that activity which is consistently associated with the stimulus processing in a
timelocked way. The ERP thus reflects, with high temporal resolution, the patterns of neuronal
activity evoked by a stimulus.</p>
      <p>Quantitative electroencephalography
Technological advances increased the ability of encephalography to read brain activity data
from the entire head simultaneously. Quantitative EEG (QEEG) applies multi channel
measurements that can better determine spatial structures and localize areas with brain
activity or abnormality. The results are often used for topographic brain mapping
represented with color maps in 2D and 3D to enhance visualization.
Brain computer interface (BCI) is a communication system that recognizes user’s command
only from his or her brainwaves and reacts according to them. For this purpose PC or/and
subject is trained. Simple task can consist of desired motion of an arrow displayed on the
screen only through subject’s imaginary of the motion of his or her left or right hand. As
the consequence of imaging process, certain characteristics of the brainwaves are raised
and can be used for user’s command recognition, e.g. motor mu waves (brain waves of alpha
range frequency associated with physical movements or intention to move) or certain ERPs.
So-called mindmachines or brainmachines are devices for induction of different mind states
(e.g. relaxation, top performance) by entrainment of the brain waves into desired frequency
bands by repetitive visual and audio stimuli. For making the training more effective,
biofeedback methods were involved. Originally, changes in finger skin resistance or
temperature were monitored. EEG biofeedback or neurofeedback uses EEG signal for
feedback input. It is suggested that this learning procedure may help a subject to modify
his or her brainwave activity.</p>
      <p>One of the methods involved in neurofeedback training is the so-called frequency following
response. Changes in the functioning of the brain in desired way, e.g. increase in alpha
activity generate appropriate visual, audio, or tactile response. Thus, a person can be aware
of the right direction of the training. Some researchers assume that subjects can improve
their mental performance, normalize behavior, and stabilize mood through the positive or
negative feedback loop, while others are skeptical on these controversial issues. There are
some findings indicating applications to certain range of conditions, as attention deficit
disorder, depression, epilepsy, and alcoholism.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="9">
      <title>6. EEG recording techniques</title>
      <p>The EEG is usually recorded with the subject awake but resting on a bed with their eyes
closed. The EEG is sometimes recorded when the patient is asleep or performing normal
daily tasks. In order not to disturb the patient, only the electrodes, preamplifiers and
stimulators are with the patient. Telemetry is used to communicate with the rest of the
equipment in a different room.</p>
      <p>Encephalographic measurements employ a recording system consisting of
- Electrodes read the signal from the head surface.
- Aamplifiers bring the microvolt signals into the range where they can be digitized
accurately.
- Converter changes signals from analog to digital form.
- Personal computer (or other relevant device) stores and displays obtained data.
Scalp recordings of neuronal activity in the brain, identified as the EEG, allow measurement
of potential changes over time in basic electric circuit conducting between signal (active)
electrode and reference electrode. Extra third electrode, called ground electrode, is
needed for getting differential voltage by subtracting the same voltages showing at active
and reference points. Minimal configuration for mono-channel EEG measurement consists of
one active electrode, one (or two specially linked together) reference and one ground
electrode. The multi-channel configurations can comprise up to 128 or 256 active
electrodes.
The EEG recording electrodes and their proper function are critical for acquiring
appropriately high quality data for interpretation. Many types of electrodes exist, often
with different characteristics. Basically there are following types of electrodes:
For multichannel montages, electrode caps are preferred, with a large number of electrodes
installed on its surface (Figure 3). Commonly used scalp electrodes consist of Ag-AgCl disks,
1 to 3 mm in diameter, with long flexible leads that can be plugged into an amplifier. AgCl
electrodes can accurately record also very slow changes in potential. Needle electrodes are
used for long recordings and are invasively inserted under the scalp. Skin preparation
differs, generally cleaning of the skin surface from oil and brushing from dried parts is
recommended. With disposable and disc electrodes, abrasive paste is used for slight skin
abrasion. With cap systems, abutting needle at the end of injection is used for skin
scraping, which can cause irritation, pain and infection. Especially when person’s EEG is
measured repeatedly and cap is mounted for the same electrode points, there is a threat of
certain pain and bleeding. That is why the right hygiene and safety protocol should be kept.
Using the silver-silver chloride electrodes, the space between the electrode and skin should
be filled with conductive paste also helping to stick. With the cap systems, there is a small
hole to inject conductive jelly. Conductive paste and conductive jelly serve as media to
ensure lowering of contact impedance at electrode-skin interface.</p>
      <p>Three types of electrode connections are used:</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="10">
      <title>1. Bipolar (between pairs of electrodes, usually adjacent).</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="11">
      <title>2. Monopolar (between one electrode and a distant reference electrode usually attached to one or both earlobes).</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="12">
      <title>3. Monopolar (between one electrode and a reference formed by averaging all the other</title>
      <p>In 1958, International Federation in Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology
adopted standardization for electrode placement called 10-20 electrode placement system.
Electrodes are small, disposable, self-adhesive and contain their own electrode gel. This
system standardized physical placement and designations of electrodes on the scalp. The
head is divided into proportional distances from prominent skull landmarks (nasion,
preauricular points, inion) to provide adequate coverage of all regions of the brain. Label
1020 designates proportional distance in percents between ears and nose where points for
electrodes are chosen. Electrode placements are labeled according adjacent brain areas: F
(frontal), C (central), T (temporal), P (posterior), and O (occipital). The letters are
accompanied by odd numbers at the left side of the head and with even numbers on the
right side (Figure 4). Left and right side is considered by convention from point of view of a
subject.
As it is known from tomography, different brain areas may be related to different
functions of the brain. Each scalp electrode is located near certain brain centers:</p>
      <p>However the scalp electrodes may not reflect the particular areas of cortex, as the exact
location of the active sources is still open problem due to limitations caused by the
nonhomogeneous properties of the skull, different orientation of the cortex sources,
coherences between the sources, etc.</p>
      <p>High impedance can lead to distortions, which can be difficult to separate from actual
signal. It may allow inducing outside electric frequencies on the wires used or on the body.
Impedance monitors are built in some commercially available EEG devices. In order to
prevent signal distortions, impedances at each electrode contact with the scalp should all be
bellow 5 K Ohms, and balanced within 1 K Ohm of each other. Similar standard is required
for clinical use of the EEG and for publication in most reputable journals. Practically,
impedance of the whole circuit comprising two electrodes is measured, but built in
impedance checks usually display results already divided by two. Control of all impedances is
desirable also after finishing every single measurement.</p>
      <p>Several different recording reference electrode placements are mentioned in the
literature. Physical references can be chosen as vertex (Cz), linked-ears, linked-mastoids,
ipsilateral-ear, contralateral-ear, C7 reference, bipolar references, and tip of the nose.
Reference-free techniques are represented by common average reference, weighted
average reference, and source derivation. Each technique has its own set of advantages and
disadvantages. The choice of reference may produce topographic distortion if relatively
electrically neutral area is not employed. Linking reference electrodes from two earlobes or
mastoids reduces the likelihood of artificially inflating activity in one hemisphere.
Nevertheless, the use of this method may drift away "effective" reference from the
midline plane if the electrical resistance at each electrode differs. Cz reference is
advantageous when it is located in the middle among active electrodes however for close
points it makes poor resolution. Reference-free techniques do not suffer from problems
associated with an actual physical reference. Referencing to linked ears and vertex (Cz) are
predominant.</p>
      <p>With modern instrumentation, the choice of a ground electrode plays no significant role in
the measurement. Forehead (Fpz) or ear location is preferred, but sometimes wrist or leg is
also used. The combination of all active electrodes with reference and ground electrode
composes channels. The general configuration is called montage.
The signals need to be amplified to make them compatible with devices such as displays,
recorders, or A/D converters. Amplifiers adequate to measure these signals have to satisfy
very specific requirements. They have to provide amplification suitable to the physiological
signal, reject superimposed noise and interference signals, and guarantee protection from
damages through voltage and current surges for both patients and electronic equipment.
The basic requirements that a biopotential amplifier has to satisfy are:
- The physiological process to be monitored should not be influenced in any way by the
amplifier.
- The measured signal should not be distorted.
- The amplifier should provide the best possible separation of signal and interference.
- The amplifier has to offer protection of the patient from any hazard of electric shock.
- The amplifier itself has to be protected against damages that might result from high input
voltages as they occur during the application of defibrillators or electrosurgical
instrumentation.</p>
      <p>The input signal to the amplifier consists of five components:</p>
      <p>Proper design of the amplifier provides rejection of a large portion of the signal
interference. The desired biopotential appears as the differential signal between the two
input terminals of the differential amplifier. The amplifier gain is the ratio of the output
signal to the input signal.</p>
      <p>In order to provide optimum signal quality and adequate voltage level for further signal
processing, the amplifier has to provide a gain of 100-100,000 (the highest need not to be
the best, combination of more parameters is involved, e.g. the range of the A/D converter,
sampling rate, noise of the used elements) and needs to maintain the best possible
signal-tonoise ratio.</p>
      <p>In order to decrease an impact of electrically noisy environment, differential amplifiers
must have high common-mode rejection ratios (at least 100 dB) and high input impedance (at
least 100 M Ohms). The common-mode rejection ratio is the ratio of the gain of differential
mode (wanted signal) over the gain of the common mode (original input signal between the
inputs and ground).</p>
      <p>Special electrically shielded rooms minimize the impact of urban electric background, in
particular 50/60 Hz alternating current line noise. For usual medical purposes, shielded
room is not necessary. For research purposes when maximal amount of information is
desired, shielded room is used. Then amplifiers run on batteries and an optical cable leads
to the PC standing outside from the shielded space. In addition to the optical cable,
electrical/optical and optical/electrical converters are necessary. Usually information of
interest lies bellow this line noise and we can use low-pass filters with cut-off bellow 50/60
Hz, or for keeping higher frequency bands a notch filter can be applied, that is able to
reduce only a narrow band around 50/60 Hz (but distorts phases).</p>
      <p>When computers are used as recording devices, channels of analog signal are repeatedly
sampled at a fixed time interval (sampling interval), and each sample is converted into a
digital representation by an analog- to-digital (A/D) converter. The A/D converter is
interfaced to a computer system so that each sample can be saved in the computer’s
memory. The resolution of the converter is determined by the smallest amplitude that can
be sampled. This is obtained by dividing the voltage range of the A/D converter by 2 raised
to the power of the number of bits of the A/D converter. A/D converter usually uses
minimally 12 bits (discerning 4,096 value levels). Ability to resolve 0.5 µV is recommended.
Sufficient sampling rate is required, at least double of the highest frequency component of
our interest.</p>
      <p>Analog (hardware) filters have to be integrated in the amplification unit. A high-pass filter
is needed for reducing low frequencies coming from bioelectric flowing potentials
(breathing, etc.), that remain in the signal after subtracting voltages toward ground
electrode. Its cut-off frequency usually lies in the range of 0.1-0.7 Hz. To ensure that the
signal is band limited, a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency equal to the highest
frequency of our interest is used (in the range from 40 Hz up to less than one half of the
sampling rate). Analog low-pass filters prevent distortion of the signal by interference
effects with sampling rate, called aliasing, which would occur if frequencies greater than
one half of the sampling rate survive without diminishing.</p>
      <p>Once data are stored, digital filtering can be used. The strength of the analog filters is
limited thus for displaying and processing of the signals further decreasing of DC
components is usually needed. It is possible to choose from linear (FIR, IIR) filtering or
novel non-linear filtering methods. The choice should be done according to the objectives
put on the signal processing. Predominantly finite impulse response (FIR) filters are used
which do not distort wave phases. The data points width typically range on the order of
1000 and one of the window function (Blackman, Hanning, Hamming, or rectangular) should
be chosen. Filters should be designed in a way to influence useful signal properties minimally.
Before performing the final measurements the whole EEG system should be tested.
Interchannel calibrations with known wave signal parameters should not display significant
discrepancies. The output noise (referred to input) consists mainly from the noise caused by
the analog amplifier circuitry and by A/D converter circuitry. Noise value should be
consistent with manufacturer information, about 0.3-2 µV pp. (range from negative peak to
positive peak) but this value depends on the way of noise estimation and on the system
configuration (low-pass filter, sampling rate, choice of circuitry). The noise can be
determined by connecting the inputs of the amplifier together, or abased them into a salty
solution, or "short-circuiting" the inputs, and then measuring the output of the amplifier.
The number of useful information bits can be counted as a power of two from the ratio of
average EEG signal amplitude over the noise amplitude (e.g. 50 µV/1 µV results in over 5
bits).</p>
      <p>One of the limitations of recordings is due to storage requirements. For example, 1 hour of
eight channels 14-bit signal sampled with 500 Hz occupies 200 MB of the memory. There
exist portable recording systems used for longer monitoring of a subject without limiting
movement of a person. Some ofthe commercial EEG recording systems comes from the
following suppliers: Lexicor, Electrical geodesics, Biosemi, NeuroScan, Sigma Medizin,
Contact Precision Instruments, Stellate, Thought Technology, Xltek.
Among basic evaluation of the EEG traces belongs scanning for signal distortions called
artefacts. Usually it is a sequence with higher amplitude and different shape in comparison
to signal sequences that doesn’t suffer by any large contamination. The artefact in the
recorded EEG may be either patient-related or technical. Patient-related artefacts are
unwanted physiological signals that may significantly disturb the EEG. Technical artefacts,
such as AC power line noise, can be decreased by decreasing electrode impedance and by
shorter electrode wires. The most common EEG artefact sources can be classified in
following way:
Excluding the artefact segments from the EEG traces can be managed by the trained
experts or automatically. For better discrimination of different physiological artefacts,
additional electrodes for monitoring eye movement, ECG, and muscle activity may be
important.</p>
      <p>Notes on experimental set-up
For data acquisition of suitable quality, a choice of the right representative group of
volunteers with appropriate spectrum of demographic data and other parameters should be
considered. The position of subjects during the EEG measurements should be comfortable
enough to avoid unwanted activities, a lying position diminishes the occurrence of some
artefacts caused by feeble motion, on the other hand it may lead towards sleeping,
especially when a darkened noiseless room is designed. Keeping of the same conditions and
instructions for the subjects for the whole length of the experiment period is desired.</p>

      <title>7. Conclusion</title>
      <p>Electroencehalography belongs to electrobiological imaging tools widely used in medical and
research areas. EEG measures changes in electric potentials caused by a large number of
electric dipoles formed during neural excitations. EEG signal consists of different brain
waves reflecting brain electrical activity according to electrode placements and functioning
in the adjacent brain regions. For using EEG techniques, the following recording system
components are necessary:
- Electrode cap with conductive jelly or Ag-AgCl disc electrodes with conductive paste.
- Amplifiers with overall amplification gain between 100-100,000, with input impedances at
least 100 MOhms, and common-mode rejection ratio at least 100 dB.
- Analog filters integrated in the unit with high pass filter with cut-off frequency in the
range of 0.1-0.7 Hz and low pass filter with cut-off frequency less than one half of the
sampling rate. In fact, frequencies above 50 Hz are rarely involved as they contribute
negligibly to power spectrum of EEG.
- At least 12 bit A/D converter with accuracy lower than overall noise (0.3-2 µV pp.), and
sampling frequency usually between 128 – 1024 Hz.
- Sufficiently quick PC for taking over data for recording and eventually for online analysis,
with adequate volume of hard disc.
- Digital high-pass FIR filter with similar cut-off frequency as analog high pass.
The general quality of recording equipment depends on the right combination of the
mentioned parameters. Before further data processing, raw EEG signal should be checked
for artefacts.</p>

      <title>8. Future Developments</title>
      <p>Attempts have been made to produce three-dimensional pictures of the brain from the EEG
recordings. However this has not been successful as the recordings deep within the brain
tend to be swamped by those closer to the surface and the brain and surrounding head are
not homogeneous volume conductors, so that it is not possible to localise potentials
accurately.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="15">
      <title>9. Other recording techniques</title>
      <p>Electromyograms (EMG), i.e. recordings made from muscle fibres, may be used to assess
muscle disease or defects in the enervation of muscles, such as those that occur after
trauma to their nerve supply. If the nerve supply is partially lost, instead of continuous
patterns of muscle fibre action potentials being seen, only occasional ones are recorded.
When a muscle is re-enervated after trauma to the nerve supply, some muscle fibres will
take their supply from adjacent intact nerve fibres if the original nerve fibres fail to grow
back. This causes muscle action potentials to occur in groups, instead of a more continuous
spread.</p>
      <p>The electrical currents associated with action potentials produce very weak magnetic fields.
Typically the magnetic field of an alpha wave 5 cm from the scalp is 0.1 rT, whereas the
earth’s magnetic field is ~50 mT. The use of superconducting quantum interference devices
(SQID) has enabled these fields to be recorded from the brain with the patient in a
magnetically shielded room. These recordings are known as a magnetoencephalogram (MEG).
There are some theoretical and practical differences between EEG and MEG. Although the
same electrical currents produce the MEG, it can provide complementary information to
EEG.</p>
      <p>Electroneurograms (ENG), i.e. recordings made from nerves while stimulating them by
electrical pulses or other means, may be used in conjunction with an EEG to test for
peripheral and central nerve defects. Peripheral nerve defects may be found in vitamin
deficiency, poisoning by alcohol or other substances or after injury. Central nerve defects
may be found in demyelinating diseases, such as MS. Defects are shown by the lack of a
response or the delay in response to a stimulus, which may be measured at any point along
the pathway in the peripheral or central nervous system.</p>
